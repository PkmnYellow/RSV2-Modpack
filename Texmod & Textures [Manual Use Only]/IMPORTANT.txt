Run Texmod Configuration.bat first, and run texmod autoload.exe in ADMIN MODE. Completely separate from the main installer.

You do have to re-run texmod autoload.exe if you want the retextures.

-Compatibility-
1. This WILL NOT work alongside with TeknoR6Vegas2.exe. It has to be one or the other.

-Known Issues-
1. If you do not run texmod autoload.exe in Admin mode, and R6Vegas2_Game.exe runs in Admin mode via texmod, it will throw an error.
2. Without texmod autoload.exe in Admin mode, the Terrorist Hunt Control V1.0 keybinds will most likely not work.
